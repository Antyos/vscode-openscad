- Configurations
    - `openscad.launchPath` - Overrides default path to `openscad` executable.

### Changed

- `scad.cheatsheet` command is now `openscad.cheatsheet` for consistancy with configurations
- `openscad.cheatsheet.openToSide` configuration is an enumerated string instead of a boolean for improved clarity. Options now include `beside` (was `true`) and `currentGroup` (was `false`)

## [[0.1.2](https://github.com/Antyos/vscode-openscad/releases/tag/v0.1.2)] - (2020-03-23)

### Fixed

- Fixed syntax highlighting not working on case sensitive operating systems (i.e. Linux)

## [[0.1.0](https://github.com/Antyos/vscode-openscad/releases/tag/v0.1.0)] - (2020-03-17)

### Added

- Syntax highlighting for OpenSCAD Customizer widgets. Highlighting support includes:
    - Drop down boxes
    - Slider
    - Tabs
- `Open OpenSCAD Cheatsheet` command to natively launch the OpenSCAD cheatsheet in VSCode
    - Included a status bar icon for easy access to the command
    - By default, it is visible whenever a `.scad` file is in an open tab
- Extension Configurations:
    - `openscad.cheatsheet.displayInStatusBar`: When the "Open Cheatsheet" button should be displaying in the status bar
